# Track-and-Field-Fantasy
A locally hosted website that runs a Track and Field fantasy sports league according to (a slightly modified version of) the official World Athletics rules from 2007.

Unzip to your desktop (you might have to do this multiple times, so do it until you get to the point where there is a (non compressed) folder called my-app-Copy on your desktop), open a terminal in the folder and run this command:

npm run dev

Then control-click on the URL and it'll open it in your default browser.  I used ChatGPT to try to make messy code more accessible, and also generate most of the code.  Once you open it in your browser, it should be pretty intuitive.

In the data admin tab, you can upload the provided CSV to import all the athletes for the Tokyo 2025 World Championship automatically.
